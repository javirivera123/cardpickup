Building CardPickup (pick your favorite option):
•	Add source files located in src directory to your favorite IDE. Add the CSV jar to your project library. Compile and run GameMaster.
•	Compile code in src directory via command line and add CSV jar to your classpath. Run GameMaster.
•	If you have ant installed from the root directory execute “ant” in the command line. You can “ant clean” to remove the build and “ant doc” to build the javadoc.
Making a Player:
1.	Extend the Player class to create your own player agent class.
2.	Use TestPlayer as an example.
3.	Make sure to change the name of your player. Think of something creative and unique.
4.	Put your author information in the javadoc. Do not leave the author as Marcus Gutierrez or Oscar Veliz. You’re laughing thinking someone wouldn’t be that silly but this README file is guaranteeing you that someone in the class will do just that.

Running agents from the Game master:
1.	Specify the number of games you want your agent to run on.
2.	Add your agent to the section in main that says to “add your agent here”.
3.	Add your Player to the getPlayer() method.
